# Real-time Streaming Analytics Accelerator

This accelerator provides a framework for processing real-time data streams using AWS services like Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, and Databricks Structured Streaming. It's designed to handle high-volume data ingestion, transformation, and storage for various use cases.

## Purpose

The accelerator processes real-time logs, financial transactions, sensor data, and other streaming data to generate actionable insights.

## Implementation

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Amazon Kinesis (or Kafka) ingests the incoming data stream.
2.  **Real-time Processing:** Databricks Structured Streaming performs transformations and writes the processed data to Delta Lake.
3.  **Storage:** Processed insights are stored in Amazon Redshift or S3 for analysis and reporting.

## Use Cases

1.  **Log Analytics:** Continuously process logs from applications, servers, or security systems to detect anomalies, failures, or security threats in real time.
2.  **Financial Transactions Monitoring:** Monitor payment transactions for fraud detection, compliance checks, and anomaly detection.
3.  **IoT & Sensor Data Processing:** Analyze real-time sensor readings from industrial machines, vehicles, or smart devices to identify operational issues or optimize performance.
4.  **Clickstream Analysis:** Track user behavior on websites or mobile apps to personalize recommendations and detect potential bot traffic.
5.  **Stock Market & Trading Analytics:** Process financial market data streams to execute algorithmic trading or provide real-time insights to traders.

## Key Benefits

1.  **Low-latency insights:** Enables immediate decision-making based on real-time data.
2.  **Scalability:** Handles large volumes of streaming data efficiently.
3.  **Cost-effectiveness:** Leverages serverless processing with AWS Lambda for certain tasks.
4.  **Integration with BI tools:** Seamlessly integrates with BI tools like QuickSight, Tableau, or Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

## Solution Overview

The solution comprises the following components:

1.  **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Terraform manages the provisioning of AWS resources, including Kinesis, Redshift, S3, and Lambda.
2.  **Streaming Data Ingestion:** AWS Kinesis captures and buffers the incoming real-time events.
3.  **Real-time Processing:** Databricks Structured Streaming transforms the data and writes it to Delta Lake for efficient storage and querying.
4.  **Storage:** Processed data is stored in Amazon Redshift and S3, providing flexibility for different analytical needs.

## Databricks Structured Streaming Code

### Initializing Spark Session
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, from_json
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StringType, IntegerType

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("RealTimeStreamingAnalytics") \
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "com.databricks:spark-redshift_2.12:2.0.1") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

### Defining Schema for Incoming Data
```python
schema = StructType() \
    .add("event_id", StringType()) \
    .add("user_id", StringType()) \
    .add("transaction_amount", IntegerType()) \
    .add("event_timestamp", StringType())
```

### Reading Streaming Data from Kinesis
```python
kinesis_stream = spark.readStream \
    .format("kinesis") \
    .option("streamName", "real-time-stream") \
    .option("region", "us-east-1") \
    .option("initialPosition", "LATEST") \
    .load()
```

### Parsing JSON Data
```python
parsed_stream = kinesis_stream \
    .selectExpr("CAST(data AS STRING) as jsonData") \
    .select(from_json(col("jsonData"), schema).alias("data")) \
    .select("data.*")
```

### Writing to Delta Lake
```python
delta_path = "s3://streaming-processed-data-bucket/delta-lake/"
query = parsed_stream.writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", delta_path + "/checkpoint/") \
    .start(delta_path)

query.awaitTermination()
```
